                  Thanks for asking. As you can deduce from the header, my name is Aditi Rajagopal. I'm a software engineer, inventor, University Michigan grad, freelancer, and artist. I'm also an active member of the Society of Women Engineers; I'm a mentor for the University of Michigan and University of Minnesota student sections, a member of the WELocal Milwaukee planning committee, and incoming treasurer of the Minnesota Professional Section.

                  I currently work at IBM as a front-end developer on the IBM Container Service (based out of Rochester, Minnesota). I have way too many canvases in progress, and I'm currently working on a re-branding project for Kellie, a friend of mine, and a local business owner. I'm also going through the onboarding process of becoming the treasurer of the Minnesota Professional Section of the Society of Women Engineers (the largest professional section of SWE in the United States).

                  Perhaps. I'm open to relocating for a job that I can really sink my teeth into, and for a team that will enable me to learn, and build on my existing skills. My professional interests include: front-end development, design, strategy, and brand management. If you can give me an opportunity to expand my horizons beyond the technical realm and into the business side of things, I'd be really interested.

                  <i>Does anyone really code from scratch anymore?</i> <br><br> In all seriousness, I don't code from scratch (i.e blank page to full-blown app) very often. Even this website was forked from a gatsby template, and uses various libraries. I debated whether to build this website from scratch, and decided 5% in that it wasn't worth the time -- because #priorities yo. <br><br> That doesn't mean that I can't. It just means that I appreciate the multitudes of libraries and open source projects that are out there on the interwebs.

                  Mostly yes. My previous website used a Jekyll backend, but since I've been coding primarily in ReactJS at work, I wanted to experiement with a ReactJS based backend. This website uses a gatsby backend, and is forked from <a href="https://github.com/jaxx2104/gatsby-starter-bootstrap">here.</a> #sorrynotsorry.

                  Here's what I can bring to the table: <br>
                  <li>Front-end Dev skills (ReactJS, HTML/CSS/SASS)</li>
                  <li>Graphic Design skills (Adobe suite, and an eye for pretty things)</li>
                  <li>Effective communication skills (writing, public speaking, teaching experience)</li>
                  <li>A 'can-do' attitude & realistic perspective</li>
                  If that sounds good to you, feel free to shoot me a message on twitter or via email. <br><br>
                  <b>Disclaimer:</b> I run on the philosophy that side-projects are supposed to be FUN and/or EDUCATIONAL. So if things start feeling like a chore, and we can't settle our (creative) differences... I have dibs on looking for the nearest exit.
